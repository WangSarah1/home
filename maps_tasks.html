		<h1>Maps</h1>
		<h2>
			Among Us contains multiple different maps players can play on. Below are images of these
			locations, as well as some defining characteristics:
		</h2>
		
		<h3>The SKELD:</h3>
			<p>
				The SKELD is the "first" map in the game. It's usually known as the default map, as it's
				the one players tend to play the most. This is proven by the general archetecture of the
				starting screen, where players seem to be in the "dropship" part of the map.
				The design is pretty straightforward, featuring all
				of the game's most famous locations (Electrical, Medbay, Navigation). Lore wise, the map is thought of 
				as a spaceship, transporting players between MIRA HQ and POLUS.
				<br>
				Some tasks are exclusive to The SKELD. These include "Align Enginge Output" and "Empty Chutes".

		<h3>MIRA HQ:</h3>
			<p>
				MIRA HQ is the smallest Among Us map, usually referred to as "the worst" by hardcore players. It
				features a very futuristic design, where the hallways look extremely clean and polished. 
				MIRA also proves other forms of life exist in the game, as there is a large tree encased in glass.
				This tree is one of the defining features of the map. Others include the sensors (see more in <a href = "#otherinteractions">Sabotages and Other Interactions</a>)
