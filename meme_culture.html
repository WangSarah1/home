		<h1>Memes</h1>
		<h2>During its popularity, Among Us created a new section of the internet. It's full of bad jokes and references to the game, usually referred to as an "Among Us Meme".</h2>
		<hr>
		
		<!-- Talking about the slang that originates from the game, you've probably heard these terms being used -->
		<h2>Slang</h2>

			<p>
				Among Us heavily popularized the use of the words &quot;sus&quot; and &quot;sussy&quot;, which are shortened versions of the words suspicious/suspect.
				These words were originally used in Among Us game chats, referring to a player who someone thought was the Impostor. 
				However, this language quickly spread out of the game and into everyday life. People were referring to everything as &quot;sus&quot;, making it 
				a big part of Gen Z language. 
				<br>
				The game also popularized phrases like &quot;when the impostor is sus&quot;, &quot;you vented&quot;, &quot;red is sus&quot;, etc.

		<h2>Memes</h2>
			<p>
				Adding on to the new slang, the game created this &quot;internet trend&quot; where people will post photos of things slightly resembling the Crewmate.
				This is usually quick scribbles and doodles, although some people wanted to be a bit more creative, meming trash cans and school bells.
				Many think these memes are a plague to our generation, poisoning the minds of children. 
				<br>
				For some reason, the Red colour is thought of as the &quot;most sus&quot;. This could be because red is generally associated with Among Us's branding,
				where the Red Crewmate/Impostor is seen as a mascot. Even if some people think this meme is overused,
				it does not stop others from meming the game as much as they can.
