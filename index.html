		<h2>What is Among Us?</h2>
			<p>
				Among Us is a popular <b>online multiplayer</b> video game by <i>Innersloth</i>. 
				It can be played with 4-15 people (a lobby) across multiple platforms (PC, Mobile, Playstation, xBox, even in VR!).
				The game itself is heavily inspired by "Mafia" and "Clue", where players try to solve a 
				murder mystery like scenario. Players play as <b>Crewmates</b> on a spaceship, trying to
				figure out who the <b>Imposters</b> are to save their ship (and their lives).

			<p>
				The game can be played with 4-15 players. When the game starts, each player is randomy assigned a role, either
				Crewmate or Impostor (1-3 players). Imposters will know who the other imposters are, but Crewmates will not. Players are then released onto the selected map and start the game.
				<br>
				<br>
				This is where the social deduction part comes in play. As Crewmates are doing their tasks and filling up the task bar, Impostors need
				to blend in and appear innocent (while killing off unsuspecting Crewmates). When a player finds a dead body, an emergency meeting is called. Here,
				the players discuss who they think the culprit is. The players are then given a chance to vote someone off - whoever gets
				majority votes will be ejected off the ship. During these meetings, Imposters try their best to not seem suspicious as everyone else goes over
				what they were doing, where they were, etc. 
				<br>
				Crewmates can only really do tasks and run around. Impostors, on the other hand, have a variety of new buttons. They're able to shut doors, 
				call sabotages, crawl in the vents, as well as kill Crewmates.
				<hr>
				<b>There are a couple ways for each team to win:</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Crewmates:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete all their tasks (see <a href = "maps_tasks.html">Maps and Tasks</a> for more info)</li>
					<li>Vote out all of the impostors</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Impostors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Sabotage the Crewmates (see <a href = "maps_tasks.html">Maps and Tasks</a> for more info)</li>
					<li>Kill or vote off Crewmates (They win when the number of remaining Impostors tie the number of remaining Crewmates)</li>
				</ul>

				There are multiple theories that try to explain what exactly is going on in Among Us. Here's an outline detailing everything
				we know about these strange space aliens: <a href = "https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-lore-story-the-truth-is-out-there/">https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-lore-story-the-truth-is-out-there/</a>
				<br>
				We know Impostors are parasites - this was confirmed by the developers. Many people speculate they're able to shapeshift,
				turning themselves into the recognisable Crewmate. They're also immune to oxygen and light sabotages, leading many to make the
				connection that they don't need to breathe and have night-vision. Additionally, it's likely that the Impostors had some control over
				the SKELD ship, even before the Crewmates. The main evidence for this is the <b>Impostor sabotage menu.</b>
				<br>
				Why would they have access to the control panel when Crewmates don't? Why can they vent all over the ship while Crewmates can't?
				<br>
				People also can't make up their mind when it comes to the incentive of the Crewmates. Going with what we've clarified above, it's natural to
				think the Crewmates are the bad guys, looting everything the Impostors have ever owned. The Impostors, on the other hand, are just
				trying to keep them off their ship. It's also possible the crewmates are just researchers studying space - MIRA HQ is their headquarters, the SKELD ship
				flies them through space and towards the POLUS research camp.
				<br>
				To this day, we still don't know what the real story behind Among Us is. The developers are yet to confirm many details and fan theories. Currently, 
				it's all up to the players to decide what the true meaning behind thsi game is.

				Among us also allows players to express themselves through their in-game avatar. Players are able to put on various hats, 
				suits, and other accessories. Some items (pets, etc.), however, are only accessible through the <b>$5</b> paid version of the game.
