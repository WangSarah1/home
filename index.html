		<h2>What is Among Us?</h2>
			<p>
				Among Us is a popular <b>online multiplayer</b> video game by <i>Innersloth</i>. 
				It can be played with 4-15 people across multiple platforms (PC, Mobile, Playstation, xBox, even in VR!).
				The game itself is heavily inspired by "Mafia" and "Clue", where players try to solve a 
				murder mystery like scenario. Players play as <b>Crewmates</b> on a spaceship, trying to
				figure out who the <b>Imposters</b> are to save their ship (and their lives).

			<p>
				The game can be played with 4-15 players. When the game starts, each player is randomy assigned a role, either
				Crewmate or Impostor (1-3 players). Imposters will know who the other imposters are, but Crewmates will not. Players are then released onto the selected map and start the game.
				<br>
				<br>
				This is where the social deduction part comes in play. As Crewmates are doing their tasks and filling up the task bar, Impostors need
				to blend in and appear innocent (while killing off unsuspecting Crewmates). When a player finds a dead body, an emergency meeting is called. Here,
				the players discuss who they think the culprit is. The players are then given a chance to vote someone off - whoever gets
				majority votes will be ejected off the ship. During these meetings, Imposters try their best to not seem suspicious as everyone else goes over
				what they were doing, where they were, etc. 
				<hr>
				<b>There are a couple ways for each team to win:</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Crewmates:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete all their tasks (see <a href = "maps_tasks.html">Maps and Tasks<a> for more info)</li>
					<li>Vote out all of the impostors</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Impostors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Sabotage the Crewmates (see <a href = "maps_tasks">Maps and Tasks<a> for more info)</li>
					<li>Kill or vote off Crewmates (They win when the number of remaining Impostors tie the number of remaining Crewmates)</li>
				</ul>

				There are multiple theories that try to explain what exactly is going on in Among Us. Here's an outline detailing everything
				we know about these strange space aliens: <a href = "https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-lore-story-the-truth-is-out-there/">https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-lore-story-the-truth-is-out-there/</a>

				We know Impostors are parasites - this was confirmed by the developers.

				Among us also allows players to express themselves through their in-game avatar. Players are able to put on various hats, 
				suits, and other accessories. Some items (pets, etc.), however, are only accessible through the <b>$5</b> paid version of the game.
